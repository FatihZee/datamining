# Customer Churn Prediction using Data Mining

This repository contains a data mining project that predicts customer churn. Using machine learning techniques, the model is trained on customer data to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving the service. The project utilizes **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive web interface, allowing users to input data and view predictions in real-time.

## Features
- Predict if a customer will churn or stay.
- Interactive web interface built with **Streamlit** for easy prediction.
- Visualization of key factors contributing to churn.
- Model training using data mining techniques like decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/FatihZee/datamining.git

2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py

4. The app will open in your default web browser, where you can input customer data and see the churn prediction.

## Usage
- Enter customer data (e.g., account details, usage statistics) in the form.
- The model will predict whether the customer is likely to churn or stay.
- View visualizations of key factors influencing the prediction.

## Model
The model is trained using various classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of churn based on customer features like service usage, account age, and customer demographics.
